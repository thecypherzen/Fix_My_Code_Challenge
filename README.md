# Overview #

The **0x00. Fix my code** is an optional ALX project that allows us to * jump into an existing code base and fix it!*. Sometimes, we know the language, but sometimes we don't, that means we have to quickly learn what is needed to fix the code.

This skill is needed as a team lead, as your subordinates(or even friends) may need you to look at their code and help them debug and you just have to do that, and quickly. I personally had this first hand experience when  a friend who was doing a *Data Science* course in *January 2024* reached out to me to help him out to understand the base project base code and resolve his assignment in time. I had to learn very quickly the python *myplotlib*, *pyplot* and *nltk* modules and packgage and help out.

So yea, I love this project!
